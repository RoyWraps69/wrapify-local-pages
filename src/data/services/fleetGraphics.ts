      question: "What's the difference between fleet graphics and commercial fleet wraps?",
      answer: "Fleet graphics typically refer to partial branding elements applied to company vehicles, such as logos, contact information, and basic design elements. Commercial fleet wraps usually involve more comprehensive coverage, often wrapping larger portions or the entire vehicle. Fleet graphics are more budget-friendly when you need consistent branding across many vehicles."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you ensure consistent branding across our entire fleet?",
      answer: "We use digital templating systems specific to each vehicle model in your fleet, ensuring precise placement of all graphic elements. Our color management processes guarantee that your brand colors remain consistent across all vehicles, regardless of when they're installed. We also maintain detailed records of all specifications used for your fleet, making it easy to add new vehicles with identical graphics."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you work with our existing fleet management schedule?",
      answer: "Absolutely. We understand that keeping your vehicles on the road is critical to your business. We can develop a phased installation plan that works with your operational requirements, scheduling installations during planned maintenance periods or creating a rolling schedule that minimizes impact on your daily operations."
    },
    {
      question: "What if we add different vehicle types to our fleet later?",
      answer: "Our design team will adapt your existing graphics package to fit any new vehicle models you add to your fleet while maintaining visual consistency. We store your brand assets and specifications digitally, making it simple to scale your fleet graphics program as your business grows, regardless of what vehicles you add in the future."
