      question: "What's the difference between vehicle graphics and a full wrap?",
      answer: "Vehicle graphics are partial applications that typically cover specific portions of a vehicle, such as doors, sides, or hoods. They're ideal for displaying essential information like logos, contact details, and basic branding elements. Full wraps, on the other hand, cover most or all of a vehicle's painted surfaces for maximum visual impact and brand exposure."
    },
    {
      question: "How long do vehicle graphics typically last?",
      answer: "With proper care and maintenance, high-quality vehicle graphics can last 5-7 years. Factors that affect longevity include exposure to harsh weather conditions, frequent washing, and how the vehicle is stored. We use premium materials from 3M and Avery Dennison to ensure maximum durability for all our graphics installations."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I wash my vehicle after getting graphics installed?",
      answer: "Yes, but we recommend waiting at least 72 hours after installation before washing to allow the adhesive to fully cure. After that, hand washing with mild automotive soap is preferred. Avoid automatic car washes with brushes as they can catch edges and potentially damage the graphics. Touchless car washes are generally safe to use."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you design the graphics for my business vehicle?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Our in-house design team specializes in creating effective vehicle graphics that align with your brand identity and marketing goals. We can work from your existing branding materials or develop new concepts specifically optimized for vehicle visibility and impact. All design services include multiple concept options and revision rounds."
