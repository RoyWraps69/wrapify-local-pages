  longDescription: "Partial vehicle wraps offer an excellent middle ground between full wraps and simple decals. By strategically covering portions of your vehicle – typically 25% to 75% of the surface area – we create high-impact designs that maximize visibility while keeping costs manageable. We carefully design partial wraps to work harmoniously with your vehicle's factory paint color, creating a cohesive look that appears intentional rather than incomplete. This approach is particularly popular with small businesses looking to establish a professional presence without the investment of a full fleet wrap program.",
