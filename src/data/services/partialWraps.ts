  description: 'Make an impact without wrapping your entire vehicle. Our partial wraps focus on key areas for maximum visibility while working with your budget.',
  longDescription: "Partial vehicle wraps offer an excellent middle ground between full wraps and simple decals. By strategically covering portions of your vehicle – typically 25% to 75% of the surface area – we create high-impact designs that maximize visibility while keeping costs manageable. We carefully design partial wraps to work harmoniously with your vehicle's factory paint color, creating a cohesive look that appears intentional rather than incomplete. This approach is particularly popular with small businesses looking to establish a professional presence without the investment of a full fleet wrap program.",

    {
      question: "Which areas of the vehicle are typically included in partial wraps?",
      answer: "The most common areas for partial wraps include the hood, sides, rear, and tailgate or trunk. We strategically design partial wraps to focus on the most visible areas of your vehicle while working with your budget. The design can be tailored to cover anywhere from 25% to 75% of your vehicle, depending on your specific needs and goals."
    },
    {
      question: "Will a partial wrap look incomplete or unprofessional?",
      answer: "Not at all. Our designers are experts at creating partial wraps that look intentional and professionally integrated with your vehicle's factory paint. We carefully design the transition points and incorporate your vehicle's existing color into the overall design to create a cohesive look that appears complete and purposeful."
    },
    {
      question: "How much can I save with a partial wrap versus a full wrap?",
      answer: "Partial wraps typically cost 40-60% less than full vehicle wraps, depending on the specific coverage area and design complexity. This makes them an excellent option for small businesses or individuals looking for maximum impact with a more modest investment. Many of our clients find that strategically designed partial wraps achieve nearly the same marketing effectiveness as full wraps at a lower price point."
    },
    {
      question: "Can a partial wrap be upgraded to a full wrap later?",
      answer: "Yes, in many cases a partial wrap can be expanded to a full wrap later. However, for the most seamless results, this should be done within a reasonable timeframe to minimize color differences from UV exposure and weathering. If you're considering a future upgrade, let us know during the design phase so we can create a partial wrap with future expansion in mind."
