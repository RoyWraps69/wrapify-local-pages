      question: "How long does the vehicle wrap installation process take?",
      answer: "A complete vehicle wrap installation typically takes 3-5 business days from start to finish. This includes prep work, installation, and a final quality inspection. Partial wraps and simple color changes may require less time, while complex custom designs might take longer. We'll provide a specific timeline during your consultation."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I care for my vehicle wrap?",
      answer: "To maximize the life of your vehicle wrap, we recommend hand washing with mild automotive soap, avoiding high-pressure washers and brush car washes. Wait 72 hours after installation before washing, and try to keep the vehicle in covered parking when possible to minimize UV exposure. We provide complete care instructions after installation."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you wrap leased vehicles?",
      answer: "Yes, vehicle wraps are ideal for leased vehicles because they can be removed without damaging the original paint when the lease ends. This allows you to personalize or brand your leased vehicle while still returning it in its original condition. Just make sure to budget for professional removal before your lease return date."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between a partial and full vehicle wrap?",
      answer: "A full vehicle wrap covers all painted surfaces of your vehicle for maximum impact and color change. Partial wraps typically cover 25-75% of the vehicle, strategically focusing on specific areas to achieve high visibility while working with your existing paint color as part of the design. Partial wraps are more budget-friendly while still making a strong impression."
