  description: 'Shield your car from rocks, bugs, and road debris with our strong paint protection film. This clear film helps prevent chips and scratches while being nearly invisible.',
  longDescription: "Our premium paint protection film (PPF) is a clear, thermoplastic urethane film that we apply to the most vulnerable areas of your vehicle to protect against stone chips, bug damage, minor abrasions, and environmental contaminants. The self-healing properties allow minor scratches to disappear with heat exposure from the sun or warm water. We offer both partial installations (focusing on high-impact areas like the hood, fenders, and mirrors) and full-vehicle coverage for maximum protection. Our experienced technicians use computer-cut patterns specific to your vehicle model, ensuring a perfect fit with minimal seams.",
