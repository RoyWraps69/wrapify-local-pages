  description: 'Shield your car from rocks, bugs, and road debris with our strong paint protection film. This clear film helps prevent chips and scratches while being nearly invisible.',
  longDescription: "Our premium paint protection film (PPF) is a clear, thermoplastic urethane film that we apply to the most vulnerable areas of your vehicle to protect against stone chips, bug damage, minor abrasions, and environmental contaminants. The self-healing properties allow minor scratches to disappear with heat exposure from the sun or warm water. We offer both partial installations (focusing on high-impact areas like the hood, fenders, and mirrors) and full-vehicle coverage for maximum protection. Our experienced technicians use computer-cut patterns specific to your vehicle model, ensuring a perfect fit with minimal seams.",

    {
      question: "What areas of my vehicle should I prioritize for PPF installation?",
      answer: "The most vulnerable areas that benefit most from PPF are the front bumper, hood, side mirrors, headlights, and fenders. These areas receive the most road debris impact during driving. For luxury or high-performance vehicles, we often recommend more comprehensive coverage including rocker panels, door edges, and rear bumper areas that are prone to loading scratches."
    },
    {
      question: "How is PPF different from ceramic coating?",
      answer: "Paint Protection Film provides physical protection against rock chips, scratches, and physical impacts with its urethane material. Ceramic coating is a liquid polymer that provides chemical protection, enhanced gloss, and makes cleaning easier, but doesn't offer the same impact protection. Many clients choose to combine both - applying PPF to high-impact areas and then ceramic coating the entire vehicle for comprehensive protection."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does paint protection film last?",
      answer: "Premium paint protection films typically last 7-10 years when properly maintained. Our films include UV inhibitors that prevent yellowing and degradation from sun exposure. The film remains effective throughout its lifetime, continuing to protect against impact damage and environmental contaminants until it's removed or replaced."
    },
    {
      question: "Will PPF change the appearance of my paint?",
      answer: "High-quality PPF is virtually invisible once installed. Our premium films have exceptional clarity and don't alter the color or finish of your vehicle's paint. Some specialized PPF options can even enhance gloss levels or add a matte finish effect if desired. After proper installation and curing time, most people cannot tell the film is there except upon very close inspection."
