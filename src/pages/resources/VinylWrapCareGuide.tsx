        <p>Your vehicle wrap is an investment in your brand's visibility or your vehicle's appearance. Proper care and maintenance will ensure it continues to look great for years to come.</p>
        
        <h3>Washing Your Wrapped Vehicle</h3>
        <p>Regular washing is important to maintain your wrap's appearance and longevity. Here are the recommended steps:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hand wash with a gentle automotive detergent and a soft cloth or sponge</li>
          <li>Rinse thoroughly with clean water</li>
          <li>Air dry or use a microfiber cloth</li>
          <li>Avoid high-pressure washes, which can damage the edges of the wrap</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Removing Tough Stains</h3>
        <p>For stubborn stains like bird droppings, tree sap, or bug splatter, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Soak the affected area with warm, soapy water</li>
          <li>Let it sit for several minutes to soften the contaminant</li>
          <li>Gently wipe away with a soft cloth</li>
          <li>For persistent stains, use isopropyl alcohol diluted with water (2:1 ratio)</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Protecting Your Wrap from the Elements</h3>
        <p>Environmental factors can affect your wrap's lifespan. Consider these protective measures:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Park in a garage or covered area whenever possible</li>
          <li>Use a car cover for extended outdoor parking</li>
          <li>Avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight when possible</li>
          <li>In winter, rinse salt and road chemicals off regularly</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>What to Avoid</h3>
        <p>To prevent damage to your vehicle wrap, avoid:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Automatic car washes with abrasive brushes</li>
          <li>Harsh chemicals, solvents, or oil-based cleaners</li>

          <li>Pressure washing edges of the wrap</li>
        </ul>
