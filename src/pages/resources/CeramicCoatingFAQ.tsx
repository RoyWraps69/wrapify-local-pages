        <h2>Ceramic Coating Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        
        <div class="space-y-6">
          <div>
            <h3>What is ceramic coating?</h3>
            <p>Ceramic coating is a liquid polymer that chemically bonds with your vehicle's factory paint, creating a layer of protection that is significantly harder than clear coat. This semi-permanent bond creates a hydrophobic (water-repelling) surface that offers superior protection against environmental contaminants and UV damage.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h3>How long does ceramic coating last?</h3>
            <p>Professional ceramic coatings can last anywhere from 2-5 years, depending on the specific product used, application method, environmental exposure, and maintenance. Our premium ceramic coating packages offer up to 5 years of protection with proper care.</p>

          <div>
            <h3>What are the benefits of ceramic coating?</h3>
            <p>Ceramic coatings offer numerous benefits including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Superior protection against environmental damage (bird droppings, tree sap, road salt)</li>
              <li>Enhanced resistance to UV rays and oxidation</li>
              <li>Hydrophobic properties that make cleaning easier</li>
              <li>Improved gloss and depth to your vehicle's paint</li>
              <li>Reduced need for waxing and polishing</li>
              <li>Protection against minor scratches and swirl marks</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h3>Is ceramic coating worth the cost?</h3>
            <p>While ceramic coating represents a higher initial investment than traditional waxing, it provides superior protection and longevity, often lasting several years. For those who value their vehicle's appearance and want to maintain its resale value, ceramic coating is a cost-effective long-term solution that requires less frequent reapplication than traditional methods.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h3>Can I apply ceramic coating myself?</h3>
            <p>While DIY ceramic coating products exist, professional application ensures optimal results. Our certified installers thoroughly prepare the surface (including paint correction), apply the coating in a controlled environment, and ensure proper curing. Professional application maximizes durability and performance while avoiding common DIY issues like high spots, streaking, or improper curing.</p>

          <div>
            <h3>How do I maintain a ceramic coated vehicle?</h3>
            <p>Maintaining a ceramic coated vehicle is relatively simple:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Wash regularly with pH-neutral soap</li>
              <li>Avoid automatic car washes with abrasive brushes</li>
              <li>Use microfiber towels for drying</li>
              <li>Apply a ceramic boost spray every 3-4 months for optimal performance</li>
              <li>Address contaminants (bird droppings, tree sap) promptly</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h3>Can ceramic coating be applied over vinyl wraps?</h3>
            <p>Yes, we offer specialized ceramic coatings designed specifically for vinyl wraps. These provide the same hydrophobic properties and protection while being safe for vinyl surfaces. This combination provides maximum protection and easier maintenance for wrapped vehicles.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h3>Does ceramic coating prevent scratches?</h3>
            <p>Ceramic coating provides resistance against minor scratches and swirl marks. However, it's not scratch-proof. For maximum protection against rock chips and deeper scratches, we recommend combining ceramic coating with Paint Protection Film (PPF) in high-impact areas.</p>
