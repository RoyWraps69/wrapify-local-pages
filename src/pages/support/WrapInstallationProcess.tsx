        <h3>Step 1: Initial Consultation and Vehicle Assessment</h3>
        <p>Before any work begins, we conduct a thorough assessment of your vehicle:</p>
        <ul>

          <li>Timeline development and scheduling</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Step 2: Design and Proofing</h3>
        <p>Our design team creates your custom wrap design:</p>

        </ul>
        
        <h3>Step 3: Production and Material Preparation</h3>
        <p>Once your design is approved, we begin the production process:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Printing your design on premium 3M or Avery Dennison vinyl using high-resolution printers</li>
          <li>Lamination with protective overlaminate to enhance durability and UV resistance</li>

          <li>Preparation of additional materials needed for installation</li>
        </ul>
